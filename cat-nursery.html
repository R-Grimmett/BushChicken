            <h3>Nurseries!</h3>
            <p>Ever wonder what you call a plant shop? Thats right! A nursery!</p>
            <p>The places on this page will sell you plants that you can buy. Many also run plant workshops! In these
                workshops you can create your own plant-related craft to take home.</p>
            <p>Even though they are shops, it can be fun to look at the plants in them! Bush Chicken says you should be
                careful to not hurt the plants there though.</p>

                    <p>
                        While Mappins is a plant store, they also have their own collection to explore! You can see some
                        unique
                        succulents and vibrant tropical plants at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>They also offer workshops for you to make your own plant creations! Make sure to ask an adult if
                        you can do
                        one.</p>

                        Small, but that doesn't stop it. All The Green things is a nursery with two locations, both are
                        easily accessible.
                    </p>
                    <p>Not only that, but they also run workshops! Why not make your own green creation and take it home
                        with you?

            <h3>For Adults:</h3>
            <p>All of these Nurseries are free to enter, but obviously prioritise selling their products. Despite this,
                nurseries can be an excellent way to show children more plants that might not be commonly seen in other
                locations such as gardens. Most are also easy to get to, however,
                some might require more planning ahead of time!</p>
            <p>As always, sun protection is strongly recommended before visiting any of these locations. We recommend
                checking the weather beforehand as well as many nurseries are a combination of outdoors and indoors.</p>
