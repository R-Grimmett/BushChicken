        <h3>Looking for Nearby Greenery?</h3>
        <p>West End is such a vibrant area! Even just by looking outside you can see many trees and bushes, what if you
          want more though?</p>
        <p>You're in luck then, my fellow green explorer. There are many places you can visit in West End and nearby
          that focus on plants. I've done some of the hard work for you and collected them here for you to look at. Just
          make sure to bring an adult with you before you head out on your own.</p>

        <p>
          Free to enter and right next to the local park! This garden is great to check out to see the work of other
          plant lovers in West End. Not only that, but you can help out too! Take your closest adult and head to one of
          their working bees to become a busy gardening bee.

        <p>
          While Mappins is a plant store, they also have their own collection to explore! You can see some unique
          succulents and vibrant tropical plants at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>They also offer workshops for you to make your own plant creations! Make sure to ask an adult if you can do
          one.</p>

        <p>
          It is hard to be a fan of plants and not visit the City Botanic Gardens. While not exactly in West End, they
          are easy to get to by walking or taking the free loop bus service that runs in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't let transport get you down though! These gardens are huge, and have a large range of plants of all
          colours.

          Small, but that doesn't stop it. All The Green things is a nursery with two locations, both are easily
          accessable.
        </p>
        <p>Not only that, but they also run workshops! Why not make your own green creation and take it home with you?

        <h3>What should adults know?</h3>
        <p>This website has a mix of both free and paid activities and locations for any kid interested in plants or
          gardening.
          Unfortunately a lot of places in Brisbane related to plants are in busy locations, so Bush Chicken strongly
          recommends
          that at least 1 adult accompanies children visiting places mentioned.</p>
        <p>Good outdoor safety will go a long way in protecting both you and your kids - remember hats and sunscreen.
        </p>
        <p>More than anything, have fun! While Bush Chicken focuses on activities that children can enjoy, plants don't
          have an age limit!</p>
